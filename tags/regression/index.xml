      <description>This time, I will be predicting the prices of used cars. I&amp;rsquo;ll be building 4 different Machine Learning models and Deep Learning models. In the end, I will see which one performed better.
About the data
The dataset was part of a hiring competition that was live on machinehack.com. The goal is to predict the price of a used car by knowing some of its attributes such as model, production year, category, brand, fuel type, engine volume, mileage, cylinders, color, airbags and many more.</description>
